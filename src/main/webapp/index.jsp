    * Everyone needs to write things down.
    
    * A note-taking application makes it easy to take notes anytime, on any device, and then sync them across all your other devices.
    
    * The real trick, though, is for those notes to be useful.
    
    * The best note-taking applications give you several options for organizing your notes.
    
    * That could be folders or notebooks, but it can also be tagging and competent search.
    
    * When done well, a note-taking app lets you jot down your thoughts anytime and easily reference them later.
    
    * Having a good note-taking app is like having your own personal internet where you can look up anything you might ever need to know about your work or personal life, no matter where you are.
    
    * What movies and books did my friends recommend?
    
    * How did the client describe what they needed in that meeting last month?
    
    * Where's a copy of my eyeglasses prescription?
    
    * Note-taking apps help you be more organized and more productive even with things you wouldn't expect.
    
    * With that in mind, these are the best note-taking apps we've tested for a variety of different needs.</b>
